The source code consists of a single Python file called "cryptocurrency_value_predictor.py".
It should be compiled using the latest version of Python 3.9.
It also requires the following Python libraries to be installed:
numpy 
matplotlib
pandas
pandas-datareader
scikit-learn
tensorflow

When compiling, the terminal will give warnings from tensorflow about not being run on a GPU.
These can be ignored.

The program will ask for a cryptocurrency ticket code. This needs to be a valid code used on Yahoo Finance.
For example ADA, ETH or BTC, for Cardano, Ethereum and Bitcoin respectively.

Using a recently launched cryptocurrency such as Shiba Inu (SHIB) will yield unpredictable results,
as training is only done between the years 2016-2019.
