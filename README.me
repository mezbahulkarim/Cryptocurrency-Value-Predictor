Project Work for the Artificial Intelligence Course ID1214

This project was done in collaboration with Lukas PÃ¶ldma.

The predictions are made using the previous 9 days of the 'Closing Value' of the Cryptocurrency to predict the next day. The dataset is obtained from the YAHOO Finance API. 
The LSTM model was used for this Neural Network as it is ideal for working with time-series data. 
Information on how to run the code is in the user_manual.txt file.
